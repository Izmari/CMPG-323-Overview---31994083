# <heading 1> CMPG-323-Overview-31994083

## <heading 2> Requirements:
All students enrolled in the CMPG 323 module will be growing and enhancing skills across different concepts, tools and technology stacks. Due to the nature of CMPG 323, planning will form a crucial part of the module as it will guide all students towards allocation of time to the tasks to be completed throughout the semester. As such, including all work and scoping it accurately will form an important part of the foundation for succeeding in the module. Functional requirements refer to the functionality that a system must have and how the functions should be performed. Non-functional requirements refer to the aspects of a solution that have an impact on the quality attributes of a system (or platform). These non-functional requirements are deemed as supportive requirements to ensure that the functional requirements are implemented appropriately and according to good software practices.
